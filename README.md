Using KDE Plasma 5.8 or higher? Use the contents of this repository to create an animated wallpaper or lock screen. This is NOT my original work. I learned how to do it from a [KDE Forum](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783).

Example video at: 
[![Flaming Plasma 5.8+ Lockscreen](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/T7cHWc-OOvE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T7cHWc-OOvE)

Instructions:
Clone this repository into ~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/ (The resulting path being: "~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/org.kde.video/...".)

Now you just go into wallpaper or lock screen settings and chose "Video" instead of "Image".

Feel free to use and add to this project!
