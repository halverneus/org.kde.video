# org.kde.video

Using KDE Plasma 5.8 or higher? Use the contents of this repository to create an animated wallpaper or lock screen. This is NOT my original work. I learned how to do it from a [KDE Forum discussion](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783).

Feel free to use and add to this project!

## Example   
  
[![Flaming Plasma 5.8+ Lockscreen](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/T7cHWc-OOvE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T7cHWc-OOvE)

## Instructions  
Clone this repository into `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/` (The resulting path should be `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/org.kde.video`)

Now just go into wallpaper or lock screen settings and chose "Video" instead of "Image".

## FAQ

<b> Using org.kde.video results in black screen, how can I solve? </b>

Just install `qt-gstreamer` and `gst-libav`
